# Stock Analysis as Cellular
## General Approach
Split individual brokers into firms and make decisions based on neighbors in firm + external data on market which is noise + tip sheet based on firm neighbors. Try to develop simple rules for each broker to simulate overall market. Add variability such as risk adversity, target profit timeline, and antifragility approach.

## Benefits
Data easily available for general performance

## Downsides
Volatility of market and many directions already explored

## Overall Goal
To simulate the movement of the Dow Jones or something similar over time
