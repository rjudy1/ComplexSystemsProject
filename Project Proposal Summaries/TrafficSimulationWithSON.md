# Traffic Simulation with Self-Organizing Network
## General Approach
We plan on simulating traffic flow in urban areas in 2D space with real world traffic data from Kaggle. Then using a self-organzed network using ant algorithms, develop a traffic management software that is able to control the flow at intersections. This approach would be heavily visual in order to monitor flow of traffic.

## Benefits
Relevant data is avaiable on Kaggle. The simulated world would only exist in a plane with addition of time as another dimension. Results would be easy to verify as decreasing the average time it would take for a car to get to its destiation would be our main objective.

## Downsides
Simulation would be a simplied model of the real world and therefore would not be entirely accurate. We would additionally need to simulate our "real world data" as the flow of traffic adjusts to the self-organized network. Additioanlly, the algorithms of the self-organzing network would need to be developed along with the architecture of simulating a/multiple intersections. 

## Overall Goal
Aims to develop an adapdive traffic management system in urban areas with control of stoplights at intersections. The system would use current data collected through traffic lights to augment other traffic lights, ideally converging to a minimum average stopping time for individual drivers.
