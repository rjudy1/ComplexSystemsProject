Limited Compatibility:
Existing image compression standards are widely adopted, and compatibility with established formats may pose challenges for widespread adoption of fractal compression.

Encoding Time:
The process of encoding images using fractal compression may be time-consuming, and efforts must be made to optimize encoding times, especially for large images.
