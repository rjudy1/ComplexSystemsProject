# Magnetism as Cellular Automata
## General Approach
Model components as having positive and negative charges. These components will have simple rules to decribe their behavior and interacions between space and other components. Then places these charged components in space and visualazing the resultant structure. With more rules, containers can be constructed of rigid components - like a magnet - to simulate there interactions in space coupled with containers. Most likely instead of a matrix as neighbors, a point and raduis system would need to be developed to describe the interactions between neighbors. 

## Benefits
Cellular Automata has been proven to be able to simulate many physical phenomon - Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science". The principles which we would be working on are visual and relatively elementary.

## Downsides
From a quick search there does not appear to be any research directly describing this phenmonom, which might impose (since the idea is rudimentary) that it is a much more difficult problem to solve. 

## Overall Goal
To simulate specific magnetic affects by using cellular automana in 2D space. These affects might include but is not limited to:
- Magnetic force lines: https://javalab.org/en/magnetic_force_en/
- Physics induced by magnetic force 
- Magnetic induction: https://javalab.org/en/magnetic_induction_en/
- 3D forces
- Inducing current through magnetic feilds: https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/faraday/latest/faraday.html?simulation=faraday
