# ComplexSystemsProject

### Project Ideas
- use assumptions of power law for randomly selected stocks over various 50 year intervals both - use assumptions of antifragility for some individually and as a swarm of brokers with simple rules
- traffic simulation for optimal flow through traffic lights converging to optimal flow
    - Adaptive traffic management system using self-organizing networks
- Swarm behavior with modular/configurable robots to construct simple shapes (thinking Big Hero 6's microbots)
- The affect of varying lengths memory applied to the structures of celluar automata
- Generation of Dog coat pattern from genetics and simple rules
